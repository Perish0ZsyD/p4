# Introduction

This document aims to be a guide to the public p4lang repositories,
and some other selected public sources of information about P4,
related tools, and published research papers.

Caveat emptor: This document was last updated 2024-Jan.  Corrections
and comments are welcome.


## Quick summary

If you want to compile P4_14 and/or P4_16 source code for the bmv2
behavioral model, and use P4Runtime API, or the bmv2-custom Thrift or
command line API it provides for adding/removing table entries, then
there are enough steps involved to install these that I would
recommend following the instructions
[here](../bin/README-install-troubleshooting.md).  It will download
copies of the following p4lang repositories, as well as some others
outside of the p4lang Github organization:

* [`p4c`](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c) - P4_16 reference compiler
  (also compiles P4_14 programs)
* [`behavioral-model`](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) -
  The reference P4 software switch.  A rewrite of the behavioral model
  as a C++ project without auto-generated code.
* [`PI`](https://github.com/p4lang/PI) - An implementation framework
  for a P4Runtime server
* [`ptf`](https://github.com/p4lang/ptf) - Packet Test Framework.  PTF
  is a Python based dataplane test framework.
* [`p4runtime-shell`](https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime-shell) - An
  interactive Python shell for P4Runtime


## `p4lang` repositories by name

`p4lang` is the name of a Github
['organization'](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations).
A Github organization is a way of grouping together multiple related
repositories.

## `p4lang` repository descriptions

Glossary:

* `API` - Application Programming Interface
* `bmv2` - Behavioral Model Version 2.  Contained in the
  `behavioral-model` repository.
* `bmv2 JSON configuration file` - a data file produced by some of the
  compilers below that is read by the bmv2 behavioral model during
  initialization.  Contains all data about a particular source P4
  program that is needed by the behavioral model code to process
  packets as that P4 program specifies.
* `HLIR` - High Level Intermediate Representation.  See IR.
* `IR` - Intermediate Representation - data structures created as a
  result of parsing P4 source code, representing all relevant details
  about the source code needed for the back end portion of a compiler
  to generate configuration specific to a particular P4 target.
* `PD API` - Program Dependent API.  TBD where to find out more
  about this.
* `PI API` - Program Independent API.  See `PI` repository [docs
  directory](https://github.com/p4lang/PI/blob/master/docs/msg_format.md)
  for some more about this, although I do not know if that particular
  document is up to date with the code.
* `v1.0.x` - As of 2019-Mar-31, v1.0.5 is the latest version of the
  P4_14 specification in the v1.0.x series.  Since v1.0.3 the updates
  have been small, and primarily modify the specification to make it
  more closely match existing implementations.
* `v1.1.x` - As of 2016-Dec-14 when a draft version of the P4_16
  language specification was released, the v1.1.x series of
  specifications was no longer publicized and effectively deprecated.


### `p4c`

`p4c` is a front end compiler for both P4_14 and P4_16 programs.  The
repository also contains a back end for `behavioral-model` (aka
`bmv2`), and as of 2023, six other back end targets (see the project
README).  It is intended to be able to easily add new back ends to it.

`p4c` is written in C++, not Python as `p4-hlir` is.


### `behavioral-model`

`behavioral-model` contains the code for what is often called `bmv2`
(an abbreviation for "Behavioral Model Version 2").

The first version of the behavioral model, produced as output from the
code in the `p4c-behavioral` repository, is like a 'P4 to C compiler',
i.e. source to source translation.  Changing the P4 program requires
recompiling to a new C program, then recompiling that C code.

bmv2 is more like an _interpreter_ for all possible P4 programs, which
bmv2 configures itself to behave as, using the contents of the bmv2
JSON configuration file produced by a couple of the compilers above.
Changing the P4 source code requires recompiling it to produce a new
bmv2 JSON configuration file, but does not require recompiling bmv2.

See
[here](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model#why-did-we-need-bmv2-)
for more discussion of why bmv2 was created.


### `p4-hlir`

Written in Python.  Parses source code for P4_14 (v1.0.x) and P4
v1.1.x versions of P4.  Creates Python objects in memory representing
P4 source code objects such as headers, tables, field lists, actions,
etc.

Also performs target-independent semantic checks, such as references
to undefined tables or fields, and dead code elimination,
e.g. eliminating tables that are never applied, or actions that are
not an action of any live table.

`p4-hlir` does _not_ parse P4_16 programs.  The `p4c` repository
contains the new compiler for both P4_14 and P4_16.


### `p4c-behavioral`

Deprecated.  Use `behavioral-model` instead.

`p4c-behavioral` uses `p4-hlir` as its front end to parse source code
and produce an IR.  From that IR it generates a C/C++ behavioral model
(version 1, not for use with bmv2).  This repository has seen very few
changes since Aug 2016.  This is because bmv2 in `behavioral-model` is
recommended over this v1 kind of behavioral model (see
`behavioral-model` below for more info).

There may be a conflict between installing this software, and that in
the `p4c-bm` repo, as they both seem to install a Python module called
p4c-bm.


### `p4c-bm`

`p4c-bm` uses `p4-hlir` as its front end to parse source code and
produce an IR.  From that IR it can generate a bmv2 JSON configuration
file, used as input to the `behavioral-model`.  It can also generate
C++ PD code.


## Executable files created during installation

This section was last updated in 2019, and kept here only for
historical reference.  Later versions of p4c and behavioral-model
install additional executables not listed here.

The executables are shown with the path where they are
created/installed using the latest README instructions as of March
2017.

| Repository | Executable | Notes |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| p4-hlir    | /usr/local/bin/p4-shell      | |
| p4-hlir    | /usr/local/bin/p4-validate   | |
| p4-hlir    | /usr/local/bin/p4-graphs     | |
| p4c-bm     | /usr/local/bin/p4c-bmv2      | Compile P4_14 or v1.1 to bmv2 JSON configuration file, PD API files, and optionally a few other things. |
| p4c        | <repo_root>/build/p4c-bm2-ss | Compile P4_14 or P4_16 to bmv2 JSON configuration file |
| p4c        | <repo_root>/build/p4c-ebpf   | |

Sample command lines to compile P4 source file foo.p4 to bmv2 JSON
configuration file:

    # foo.p4 is P4_14 source code
    p4c-bmv2 --json foo.json foo.p4
    p4c --target bmv2 --arch v1model --std p4-14 foo.p4

    # foo.p4 is P4_16 source code
    p4c --target bmv2 --arch v1model foo.p4

Sample command line for converting P4_14 source code to P4_16 source
code:

    p4test --std p4-14 --pp foo-translated-to-p4-16.p4 foo-in-p4-14.p4


## Python modules created during installation

This section was last updated in 2019, and kept here only for
historical reference.  Later versions of p4lang projects install
different Python modules.

Python modules currently installed can be shown using 'pip list'
command.  You can see which directory the files are in using 'pip show
<module-name>' command.  This could be a system-wide directory
requiring root privileges, or if you have created a Python virtual
environment, it may be a directory anywhere you wish in the file
system, without requiring root privileges to add modules.

| Repository | Python module |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| p4-hlir    | p4-hlir |
| p4c-bm     | wheel (not P4-specific module) |
| p4c-bm     | Tenjin (not P4-specific module) |
| p4c-bm     | p4-hlir |
| p4c-bm     | p4c-bm |
| behavioral-model | Does not install anything that shows up in output of 'pip list', but does install many Python files in <some-python-install-dir>/dist-packages directory, e.g. bmpy_utils.py, bm_runtime/ and sswitch_runtime/ directories, and .py files that have shell wrapper scripts for them installed in /usr/local/bin, listed above |
