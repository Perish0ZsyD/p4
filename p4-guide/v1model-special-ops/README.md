# Introduction

On 2021-Dec-06, the p4c compiler's bmv2 back end with v1model
architecture was changed in how you specify what user-defined metadata
fields to preserve for the resubmit, recirculate, and clone
operations.

Here is a partial P4 program showing the new way of specifying the
user-defined metadata fields to preserve:

```
const bit<8> EMPTY_FL    = 0;
const bit<8> RESUB_FL_1  = 1;
const bit<8> CLONE_FL_1  = 2;
const bit<8> RECIRC_FL_1 = 3;

struct meta_t {
    @field_list(RESUB_FL_1, CLONE_FL_1)
    bit<8>  f1;
    @field_list(RECIRC_FL_1)
    bit<16> f2;
    @field_list(CLONE_FL_1)
    bit<8>  f3;
    @field_list(RESUB_FL_1)
    bit<32> f4;
}

control ingress(inout headers_t hdr,
                inout meta_t meta,
                inout standard_metadata_t standard_metadata)
{
    // ...

        resubmit(RESUB_FL_1);
        // The 5 is just an example clone session id, and can be any
        // number you prefer in the range that bmv2 supports.
        clone_preserving_field_list(CloneType.I2E, 5, CLONE_FL_1);

}

control egress(inout headers_t hdr,
               inout meta_t meta,
               inout standard_metadata_t standard_metadata)
{
        recirculate_preserving_field_list(RECIRC_FL_1);
        // The 5 is just an example clone session id, and can be any
        // number you prefer in the range that bmv2 supports.
        clone_preserving_field_list(CloneType.E2E, 8, EMPTY_FL);
}
```

Before 2021-Dec-06, the old way of doing this was to give a list of
user-defined metadata fields to preserve, as shown in the code snippet
below.  This method is now deprecated.

```
struct meta_t {
    bit<8>  f1;
    bit<16> f2;
    bit<8>  f3;
    bit<32> f4;
}

control ingress(inout headers_t hdr,
                inout meta_t meta,
                inout standard_metadata_t standard_metadata)
{
    // ...

        resubmit({meta.f1, meta.f4});
        // The 5 is just an example clone session id, and can be any
        // number you prefer in the range that bmv2 supports.
        clone3(CloneType.I2E, 5, {meta.f1, meta.f3});

}

control egress(inout headers_t hdr,
               inout meta_t meta,
               inout standard_metadata_t standard_metadata)
{
        recirculate({meta.f2});
        // The 5 is just an example clone session id, and can be any
        // number you prefer in the range that bmv2 supports.
        clone3(CloneType.E2E, 8, {});
}
```

This older way of doing it had bugs in the p4c implementation for the
bmv2 back end.  It also did not follow restrictions of the P4_16
language specification, e.g. that an extern function call with
direction `out` or `inout` parameters can modify those parameter
values via copy-out when the call is complete, but cannot otherwise
modify user-defined variables in a developer's P4 program at any other
time.


# Notes on the program `v1model-special-ops.p4`

The program `v1model-special-ops.p4` demonstrates the use of resubmit,
recirculate, clone, and multicast replication operations in the BMv2
simple_switch's implementation of P4_16's v1model architecture.  It
does not do anything fancy with these features, but at least it shows
how to distinguish whether a packet being processed in the ingress
control block is the result of a resubmit or recirculate operation,
vs. a new packet received from an ingress port.  Similarly whether a
packet being processed in the egress control block is the result of a
clone operation.

See [README-p414.md](README-p414.md) for a P4_14 program that
exercises similar packet operations.


# Debug tables

This program also demonstrates what I call "debug tables".  When you
use the `--log-console` or `--log-file` command line options to the
`simple_switch` command, then whenever _any_ tables are applied, the
log output shows:

+ the values of all fields in the key of those tables, with the name
  of each field next to its value,
+ whether there was a match found or not, and
+ if there was a match found, the name of the action and the values of
  its action parameters (the names of the action parameters are not
  shown, but the action parameter values are given in the same order
  they appear in your P4 source code).

"Debug tables" are simply my name for a table that has `NoAction` as
its only action, so there is never any reason to add entries to it,
they can never modify the packet or its metadata, and its only reason
for being in the program is to show in the log the values of the
fields in the key when the table is applied.  They are effectively
"debug print" commands.

Note that such debug tables are likely to be useless when compiling to
a hardware target.  Worse than useless, they might cause the program
to be larger or more complex in ways that it will not "fit" into the
target when the debug table(s) are present, even though the program
does fit when they are left out.  If you find them useful for
developing P4 programs, consider surrounding them with C preprocessor
`#ifdef` directives so that they can easily be included or left out
with a one line change (or perhaps a compiler command line option).

I tested this program with a few table entries and test packets
described below, and the resulting log output from `simple_switch` for
several test packets are also described there.

I used these versions of the p4lang/behavioral-model and p4lang/p4c
repositories in my testing:

+ p4lang/behavioral-model - git commit
  e1fcd5d54cecf7679f46ac462fdf92e049711e6c dated 2021-Dec-24
+ p4lang/p4c - git commit ce9d7df32e2ab9870b2470df0d06c3618ea6e41e
  dated 2021-Dec-23

The program demonstrates passing a list of fields to the
`recirculate_preserving_field_list()`,
`resubmit_preserving_field_list()`, and
`clone_preserving_field_list()` primitive operations, which causes the
values of those fields to be preserved with the
resubmitted/recirculated/cloned packet.


# Compiling

See [README-using-bmv2.md](../README-using-bmv2.md) for some things
that are common across different P4 programs executed using bmv2.

To compile the P4_16 version of the code (which is the only version):

    p4c --target bmv2 --arch v1model v1model-special-ops.p4
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ source code

Note that it is perfectly normal to see warning messages like this
when compiling this program:

```bash
[--Wwarn=invalid] warning: no user metadata fields tagged with @field_list(0)
[--Wwarn=invalid] warning: no user metadata fields tagged with @field_list(0)
[--Wwarn=invalid] warning: no user metadata fields tagged with @field_list(0)
[--Wwarn=invalid] warning: no user metadata fields tagged with @field_list(0)
```

This warning is issued by the compiler when you specify a field list
numeric id that is "empty", i.e. preserves no user-defined metadata
fields at all.  This is supported perfectly fine by p4c.  The warning
is just in case you forgot to add the `@field_list` annotation to one
or more metadata fields that you wanted to preserve.

Running that command will create these files:

    v1model-special-ops.p4i - the output of running only the preprocessor on
        the P4 source program.
    v1model-special-ops.json - the JSON file format expected by BMv2
        behavioral model `simple_switch`.

Only the file with the `.json` suffix is needed to run your P4 program
using the `simple_switch` command.  You can ignore the file with
suffix `.p4i` unless you suspect that the preprocessor is doing
something unexpected with your program.

The file [README-p414.md](README-p414.md) gives instructions and
details about a P4_14 program that is not the same in behavior to this
P4_16 program, but does exercise similar operations on packets.


# Running

To run the behavioral model with 8 ports numbered 0 through 7:

    sudo simple_switch --log-console --dump-packet-data 10000 -i 0@veth2 -i 1@veth4 -i 2@veth6 -i 3@veth8 -i 4@veth10 -i 5@veth12 -i 6@veth14 -i 7@veth16 v1model-special-ops.json

To get the log to go to a file instead of the console:

    sudo simple_switch --log-file ss-log --log-flush --dump-packet-data 10000 -i 0@veth2 -i 1@veth4 -i 2@veth6 -i 3@veth8 -i 4@veth10 -i 5@veth12 -i 6@veth14 -i 7@veth16 v1model-special-ops.json

CHECK THIS: If you see "Add port operation failed" messages in the
output of the simple_switch command, it means that one or more of the
virtual Ethernet interfaces veth2, veth4, etc. have not been created
on your system.  Search for "veth" in the file
[README-using-bmv2.md](../README-using-bmv2.md) for a command to
create them.

To run CLI for controlling and examining simple_switch's table
contents:

    simple_switch_CLI

General syntax for table_add commands at simple_switch_CLI prompt:

    RuntimeCmd: help table_add
    Add entry to a match table: table_add <table name> <action name> <match fields> => <action parameters> [priority]

Summary of all table entries to create:

    mc_node_associate 1113 0
    mc_node_associate 1113 1
    mc_node_associate 1113 2

Note: The control plane operation "mirroring_add 5 1" causes a packet
that is cloned to clone session id 5 (aka "mirror session id") to be
sent to output port 1.

Details of which input packets should match which sequence of table
entries are given below.  All of this can be seen in the log file
output produced using the `--log-console` option to simple_switch,
which I have saved in a separate file for each input packet.

A note on the log files:

Most lines have a time, and several other common parts to it, like
this example output line:

    [09:25:02.955] [bmv2] [D] [thread 4822] [1.0] [cxt 0] Cloning packet at ingress

Note the part `[1.0]`.  It means roughly "for original input packet
#1, this line contains info about copy #0 made of that packet".  For
packets that are not cloned or multicast replicated, this label should
remain the same for all messages about the packet.

For cloned packets, after the clone operation occurs, you will see a
mingling of some log lines with "[1.0]" and others with "[1.1]".  The
"[1.0]" lines are for the original packet, not the clone.  The "[1.1]"
lines are for the cloned packet.  simple_switch apparently processes
these two packets either via two parallel threads, or in some other
similar fashion, that causes the log lines for these two packets to be
intermingled with each other.  Try to focus on only one set of lines
if you want to follow the sequential thread of execution for one of
those two copies.

A similar thing occurs when packets are multicast replicated.  The
number before the dot is the number of the input packet, and the
number after the dot is the "copy number" for packets creatd from that
original input packet.

scapy session for sending packets
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Any process that you want to have permission to send and receive
packets on Ethernet interfaces (such as the veth virtual interfaces)
must run as the super-user root, hence the use of `sudo`:

```python
sudo scapy

resub_pkt=Ether() / IP(dst='10.1.0.101') / TCP(sport=5793, dport=80)
recirc_pkt=Ether() / IP(dst='10.1.0.201') / TCP(sport=5793, dport=80)
i2e_clone_pkt=Ether() / IP(dst='10.3.0.55') / TCP(sport=5793, dport=80)
e2e_clone_pkt=Ether() / IP(dst='10.47.1.1') / TCP(sport=5793, dport=80)
mcast_pkt=Ether() / IP(dst='225.1.2.3') / TCP(sport=5793, dport=80)

# Send packet at layer2, specifying interface
sendp(resub_pkt, iface="veth6")
sendp(recirc_pkt, iface="veth6")
sendp(i2e_clone_pkt, iface="veth6")
sendp(e2e_clone_pkt, iface="veth6")

# Standard metadata for P4_16 + v1model architecture in p4c and behavioral-model

These notes may be specific to not only p4c and behavioral-model open
source repository implementations, but perhaps even to the specific
versions below that I have tested some of this with.

+ p4lang/behavioral-model - git commit
  e1fcd5d54cecf7679f46ac462fdf92e049711e6c dated 2021-Dec-24
+ p4lang/p4c - git commit ce9d7df32e2ab9870b2470df0d06c3618ea6e41e
  dated 2021-Dec-23

This list of standard_metadata fields comes from that version of p4c,
in the file:
[p4c/p4include/v1model.p4](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/p4include/v1model.p4)

Some of these "intrinsic" or "standard" metadata fields are different
in P4_16 plus the Portable Switch Architecture (PSA).  See the [PSA
specification](https://p4.org/specs/) for the metadata that PSA has
and how its values are used.

Unless stated otherwise, assume that these values will be 0 for
recirculated or resubmitted packets at the beginning of ingress
processing, or for cloned packets at the beginning of egress
processing, _unless_ you include the field explicitly in the list of
metadata fields whose values should be preserved, as a parameter to
the `resubmit_preserving_field_list`,
`recirculate_preserving_field_list`, or `clone_preserving_field_list`
primitive operation.

At the end of ingress processing, there are multiple of these fields
that are used to determine what happens to the packet next.  You can
read the details in the method `ingress_thread` of the
p4lang/behavioral-model source file
[`targets/simple_switch/simple_switch.cpp`](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/master/targets/simple_switch/simple_switch.cpp),
but the pseudocode given in [this simple_switch
documentation](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/master/docs/simple_switch.md)
gives a good description of the behavior, as well as similar
pseudocode for what happens to the packet next at the end of egress
processing.

The `qid` field is in `queueing_metadata` defined on that page:

+ `qid` - This is in the simple_switch documentation about
  `queueing_metadata`, but is not in `v1model.p4`.  TBD: Should it be
  added to v1model.p4?


# _Caveat emptor_

This section has [moved into the `historical`
subdirectory](historical/README.md), since now it only applies to
versions of the open source P4 development tools before 2021-Dec-06.
