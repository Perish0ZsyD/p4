This software has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and
18.04.

Proceed installing manually at your own risk of
significant time spent figuring out how to make it all
work, or consider getting VirtualBox and creating an
Ubuntu virtual machine with one of the tested versions.

Here is what command 'lsb_release -a' shows this OS to be:
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu

This script builds and installs the P4_16 (and also P4_14)
compiler, and the behavioral-model software packet forwarding
program, that can behave as just about any legal P4 program.

It is regularly tested on freshly installed Ubuntu 16.04 and
18.04 systems, with all Ubuntu software updates as of the date
of testing.  See this directory for log files recording the last
date this script was tested on its supported operating systems:

    https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide/tree/master/bin/output

The files installed by this script consume about 9 GB of disk space.

On a 2015 MacBook Pro with a decent speed Internet connection
and an SSD drive, running Ubuntu Linux in a VirtualBox VM, it
took about 90 to 100 minutes.

Versions of software that will be installed by this script:

+ protobuf: github.com/google/protobuf v3.6.1
+ gRPC: github.com/google/grpc.git v1.17.2
+ PI: github.com/p4lang/PI latest version
+ behavioral-model: github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model latest version
  which, as of 2019-Jun-10, also installs these things:
  + thrift version 0.12.0 (not 0.9.2, because of a patch in this install script that changes behavioral-model to install thrift 0.12.0 instead)
  + nanomsg version 1.0.0
  + nnpy git checkout c7e718a5173447c85182dc45f99e2abcf9cd4065 (latest as of 2015-Apr-22
+ p4c: github.com/p4lang/p4c latest version
+ Mininet: github.com/mininet/mininet latest version
+ Python packages: grpcio 1.17.1, protobuf 3.6.1
+ Python packages: crcmod, latest version

Note that anything installed as 'the latest version' can change
its precise contents from one run of this script to another.
That is an intentional property of this script -- to get the
latest version of that software.  If you want particular
versions that are not the latest, you can modify this script by
adding 'git checkout <tag>' and/or 'git checkout <commit-sha>'
command at the appropriate places.
