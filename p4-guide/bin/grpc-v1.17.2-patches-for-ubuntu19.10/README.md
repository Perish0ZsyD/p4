The patch file in this directory was created by Andy Fingerhut
(andy.fingerhut@gmail.com) by experimentation, while looking for small
changes that enable the grpc v1.17.2 source code to compile without
errors on Ubuntu 19.10 Linux.  I have not considered these changes in
any deep understanding way -- I am basically tweaked things a little
bit in ways that seemed mostly harmless, until the compile succeeded.
If you want something production-worthy, I would recommend asking the
grpc developers what they would recommend, which very well might involve
using a later released version of the grpc source code.
