# This script is just a tiny excerpt from install-p4dev-v4.sh for
# installing only Mininet.  My intent is to automate some extra
# visibility into how Mininet's installation is operating, in hopes of
# learning whether it is straightforward to stop it from installing
# Python2 when run on an Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop Linux system that
# doesn't already have Python2 installed.
