# max_parallel_jobs calculates a number of parallel jobs N to run for
# a command like `make -j<N>`

# Often this does not actually help finish the command earlier if N is
# larger than the number of CPU cores on the system, so calculate a
# value of N no more than that number.

# Also, if N is so large that the processes started in parallel exceed
# the available memory on the system, it can cause the system to copy
# memory to and from swap space, which dramatically reduces
# performance.  Alternately, it can cause the kernel to kill
# processes, to reduce system memory usage, which causes the overall
# job to fail.  Thus we would like to calculate a value of N that is
# no more than:

# (currently free mem / expected mem used per parallel job)

# The caller must provide a value for "expected mem used per parallel
# job", because this code has no way to estimate that.
