# Attempting to install the p4runtime-shell package using the command

#
# $ python3
# >>> from p4.tmp import p4conig_pb2
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'p4.tmp'

# I believe this happens because before the `sudo pip3 ...' command
# below is executed, commands above have already created a directory
# /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/p4 with a tmp subdirectory and other

# /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/p4 that does _not_ have a tmp
# subdirectory.  Perhaps there is a way to run the command below and
# have it install packages in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/p4
