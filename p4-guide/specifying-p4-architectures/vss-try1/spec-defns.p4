// My intent is that Queue represents a FIFO (first-in, first-out)
// queue of elements of type T.  Some people who buy network devices
// _really_ care about packets in a single application flow leaving
// the device in the same relative order that they arrived to the
// device, at least in the common case when no table updates are being
// performed (and often they want this behavior even when most kinds
// of table updates are performed).  The performance of several
// reliable transport protocols such as some versions of TCP, and some
// versions of Infiniband RDMA, are heavily reliant upon this (they do
// not behave incorrectly if packets are reordered, but they can have
// much lower average throughput the more that packets are reordered).

// If someone wants to make a variant of these specifications where
// they explicitly want to allow behaviors where one or more of these
// "queues" can arbitrarily reorder values within them, I would
// recommend creating a different extern name for such things,
// e.g. perhaps named something like UnorderedQueue.

// specification like this is the maximum number of elements that a
// queue is allowed to contain.

    // handled by P4_16 copy-in behavior, meaning that if e is a left
    // value, the caller can modify e's value after maybe_enqueue()
    // returns, and be guaranteed that such modifications will never
    // change the value appended to the queue.
