# Introduction

The sample P4 programs in this directory are intended to be examples
of a new feature proposed for addition to the P4_16 language
specification: allowing table entries to be specified with for loops
that are effectively executed at compile time, not run time, to help
reduce the effort required to specify repetitive table entries with a
similar structure.
