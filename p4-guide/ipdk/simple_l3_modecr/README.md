`simple_l3_modecr.p4` is a fairly simple modification of the file
`simple_l3.p4` in this directory of the IPDK repository:
https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk/tree/main/build/networking/examples/simple_l3

The main difference from `simple_l3.p4` to `simple_l3_modecr.p4` is
that the latter copies parts of the 48-bit source MAC address in the
Ethernet header of received packets into several other fields of the
packet header.  This might be useful in helping to determine whether
original 48-bit source MAC address as received by the DPDK software
switch is overwritten in some later part of the system before we
record the output packet.

The pcap file was created by running this command on an Ubuntu 20.04
system with the Python scapy package installed:
```bash
./gen-pcaps.py
```
