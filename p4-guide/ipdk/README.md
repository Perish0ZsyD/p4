# Introduction

This article contains notes on installing IPDK, the open source parts
only, on an Ubuntu 20.04 system.

There are also step-by-step instructions for compiling P4 programs for
the DPDK software switch, loading the compiled programs into it, and
sending packets to it for processing.

The IPDK instructions and build scripts come from this repository:

+ https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk

The `infrap4d` program compiled and installed using the steps below is
a combination of at least the following parts:

+ The DPDK data plane, or software switch.  You may compile P4
  programs and load the binaries into it to execute them.
+ A P4Runtime API server, by default listening on TCP port 9559 for
  incoming connection requests from P4Runtime API clients
  (i.e. controller programs).
+ A gNMI server

Source: The figure on [this
page](https://ipdk.io/p4cp-userguide/overview/overview.html#infrap4d)
shows the above parts, and also some other software components
included within the `infrap4d` process.
