The files in this directory are identical to several files in the
sibling `add_on_miss0` directory.

They are arranged slightly differently form, mainly because I am
hoping to reduce the number of steps required to write a P4 program in
the base OS, copy as little as possible into the container, run a PTF
test in the container, and look at the results in the base OS.

See the instructions
[here](README-install-ipdk-networking-container-ubuntu-20.04-and-test.md#running-a-p4-program-and-testing-it-using-a-ptf-test).
) for one way to test the files in this directory.
